# netflix-to-srt-web

This website is built from code and assets stored in the [https://github.com/isaacbernat/netflix-to-srt](https://github.com/isaacbernat/netflix-to-srt) repository.
A GitHub Actions workflow automatically synchronizes changes from the development repository's `master` branch to this repository's `main` branch, which is then used for deployment.
Therefore, any issues, pull requests and such should be directed to the dev repository. Thanks.
